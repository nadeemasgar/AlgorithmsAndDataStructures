/**
 * Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
 *
 * FindingThreeDigitEvenNumbers subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
 *
 * For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 * FindingThreeDigitEvenNumbers common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
 * text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.
